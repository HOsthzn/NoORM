As software developers, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like Entity Framework have become an essential tool for simplifying the process of working with databases. These tools allow us to interact with data using object-oriented constructs instead of writing raw SQL. However, there are certain situations where using an ORM may not be feasible or the best option.

One of the most common scenarios where ORMs may not be practical is when working with legacy systems. If the existing system was built without an ORM, retrofitting it with one can be a significant undertaking that requires a lot of time and effort. In these cases, it may be more feasible to continue using raw SQL or another database access method.

Performance is another factor to consider. ORMs can introduce performance bottlenecks when working with large datasets, especially if the ORM generates suboptimal SQL. In these cases, writing raw SQL can provide better performance and may be a more appropriate solution.

Custom database engines can also pose a challenge for ORMs. If the database engine you are working with is not supported by popular ORMs, it may not be possible to use an ORM with that database. In these situations, raw SQL or another database access method may need to be used.

Security is a critical concern in many industries, particularly in the financial and medical sectors. There may be concerns about the security of the data being transmitted between the database and the ORM. In these cases, using raw SQL or another database access method may be necessary to ensure the security of sensitive data.

Finally, there may be instances where custom business logic requires more control over the underlying SQL generated by the ORM. In these cases, it may not be feasible to implement the required logic using an ORM, and raw SQL or another database access method may need to be used.

In conclusion, while ORMs like Entity Framework can simplify the process of working with databases, there are certain situations where they may not be the best option. Whether due to legacy systems, performance concerns, custom database engines, security concerns, or custom business logic, having a raw SQL option as a backup solution can provide numerous benefits.

## Usage Examples of AdoNet Class
AdoNet is a class in C# that provides a simple way to interact with a database using ADO.NET. The class is initialized with a connection string, and it provides several methods to execute database commands such as stored procedures, text commands, and scalar queries.

Here are some examples of how to use the AdoNet class:

### Initializing the AdoNet Class
```csharp
string connectionString = "Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=MyDatabase;Integrated Security=True;";
AdoNet ado = new AdoNet(connectionString);
```


### Executing a Stored Procedure
```csharp
string storedProcName = "sp_GetEmployees";
SqlParameter[] parameters = new SqlParameter[] {
    new SqlParameter("@EmpID", SqlDbType.Int) { Value = 100 }
};

var result = ado.ExecuteCommand(storedProcName, CommandType.StoredProcedure, parameters);
```

### Executing a Stored Procedure Asynchronously
```csharp
string storedProcName = "sp_GetEmployees";
SqlParameter[] parameters = new SqlParameter[] {
    new SqlParameter("@EmpID", SqlDbType.Int) { Value = 100 }
};

var result = await ado.ExecuteCommandAsync(storedProcName, CommandType.StoredProcedure, parameters);
```

### Executing a T-SQL Command
```csharp
string tsqlCommand = "UPDATE Employees SET FirstName='John' WHERE EmpID=100";

var result = ado.ExecuteCommand(tsqlCommand, CommandType.Text);
```

### Executing a T-SQL Command Asynchronously
```csharp
string tsqlCommand = "UPDATE Employees SET FirstName='John' WHERE EmpID=100";

var result = await ado.ExecuteCommandAsync(tsqlCommand, CommandType.Text);
```

### Executing a Scalar Query
```csharp
string tsqlCommand = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees";

var result = ado.ExecuteScalar<int>(tsqlCommand, CommandType.Text);
```

### Executing a Scalar Query Asynchronously
```csharp
string tsqlCommand = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees";

var result = await ado.ExecuteScalarAsync<int>(tsqlCommand, CommandType.Text);
```
