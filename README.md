When it comes to developing software applications, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like Entity Framework have become an essential tool for many developers. These tools simplify the process of working with databases by allowing developers to interact with the data using object-oriented constructs instead of writing raw SQL. However, there are a few situations where using an ORM may not be the best option.

One of the most common scenarios is when working with legacy systems. If you are dealing with an existing system that was built without an ORM, retrofitting it with an ORM can be a significant undertaking, requiring significant time and effort. In these cases, it may be more practical to continue using raw SQL or another database access method.

Another scenario is when performance is a concern. ORMs can introduce performance bottlenecks when working with large datasets, particularly if the ORM generates suboptimal SQL. In these cases, writing raw SQL can provide better performance and may be a more appropriate solution.

Custom database engines can also present a challenge for ORMs. If you are working with a custom database engine that is not supported by popular ORMs, it may not be possible to use an ORM with that database. In these situations, raw SQL or another database access method may need to be used.

Security is a critical concern for many industries, particularly in the financial and medical sectors. In these cases, there may be concerns about the security of the data being transmitted between the database and the ORM. In these situations, using raw SQL or another database access method may be necessary to ensure the security of sensitive data.

Finally, there may be instances where custom business logic requires more control over the underlying SQL generated by the ORM. In these cases, it may not be feasible to implement the required logic using an ORM, and raw SQL or another database access method may need to be used.

In conclusion, while ORMs like Entity Framework can simplify the process of working with databases, there are a few scenarios where they may not be the best option. Whether due to legacy systems, performance concerns, custom database engines, security concerns, or custom business logic, there may be situations where using raw SQL or another database access method is necessary.

## Usage Examples of AdoNet Class
AdoNet is a class in C# that provides a simple way to interact with a database using ADO.NET. The class is initialized with a connection string, and it provides several methods to execute database commands such as stored procedures, text commands, and scalar queries.

Here are some examples of how to use the AdoNet class:

### Initializing the AdoNet Class
```csharp
string connectionString = "Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=MyDatabase;Integrated Security=True;";
AdoNet ado = new AdoNet(connectionString);
```


### Executing a Stored Procedure
```csharp
string storedProcName = "sp_GetEmployees";
SqlParameter[] parameters = new SqlParameter[] {
    new SqlParameter("@EmpID", SqlDbType.Int) { Value = 100 }
};

var result = ado.ExecuteCommand(storedProcName, CommandType.StoredProcedure, parameters);
```

### Executing a Stored Procedure Asynchronously
```csharp
string storedProcName = "sp_GetEmployees";
SqlParameter[] parameters = new SqlParameter[] {
    new SqlParameter("@EmpID", SqlDbType.Int) { Value = 100 }
};

var result = await ado.ExecuteCommandAsync(storedProcName, CommandType.StoredProcedure, parameters);
```

### Executing a T-SQL Command
```csharp
string tsqlCommand = "UPDATE Employees SET FirstName='John' WHERE EmpID=100";

var result = ado.ExecuteCommand(tsqlCommand, CommandType.Text);
```

### Executing a T-SQL Command Asynchronously
```csharp
string tsqlCommand = "UPDATE Employees SET FirstName='John' WHERE EmpID=100";

var result = await ado.ExecuteCommandAsync(tsqlCommand, CommandType.Text);
```

### Executing a Scalar Query
```csharp
string tsqlCommand = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees";

var result = ado.ExecuteScalar<int>(tsqlCommand, CommandType.Text);
```

### Executing a Scalar Query Asynchronously
```csharp
string tsqlCommand = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees";

var result = await ado.ExecuteScalarAsync<int>(tsqlCommand, CommandType.Text);
```
